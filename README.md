# Format Google chat messages
Format your Google chats in `html`. This setup works for a single chat, but you could build a menu to link to multiple chats. 

The css is based on the [US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov) version 3, but could be modified to match your preferred look-and-feel.

## Setup

1. Get your chats from [takeout.google.com](https://takeout.google.com)
2. Save `[your-message-filename].json` file next to `messages.html`
3. In `messages.html`, change `messages-sample.json` to `[your-message-filename].json`.

That should be all you need to do to render your files in a human-readable format.
